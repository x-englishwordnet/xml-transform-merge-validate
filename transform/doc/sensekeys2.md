*sense_key* is an encoding of the word sense. Programs can construct a sense key in this format and use it as a binary search key into the sense index file.

A sense_key is represented as:

`sensekey := lemma % lex_sense`
		
where

- **lemma** is is the ASCII text of the word or collocation as found in the WordNet database index file corresponding to pos . lemma is in lower case, and collocations are formed by joining individual words with an underscore (_ ) character
- **lex_sense** is encoded as:

`lexsense := ss_type:lex_filenum:lex_id:head_word:head_id`
			
where

- **ss_type** is a one digit decimal integer representing the synset type for the sense. See Synset Type below for a listing of the numbers corresponding to each synset type.

- **lex_filenum** is a two digit decimal integer representing the name of the lexicographer file containing the synset for the sense. See lexnames(5WN) for the list of lexicographer file names and their corresponding numbers.

- **lex_id** is a two digit decimal integer that, when appended onto lemma , uniquely identifies a sense within a lexicographer file. lex_id numbers usually start with 00 , and are incremented as additional senses of the word are added to the same file, although there is no requirement that the numbers be consecutive or begin with 00 . Note that a value of 00 is the default, and therefore is not present in lexicographer files. Only non-default lex_id values must be explicitly assigned in lexicographer files. See wninput(5WN) for information on the format of lexicographer files.

- **head_word** is only present if the sense is in an adjective satellite synset. It is the lemma of the first word of the satellite's head synset.

- **head_id** is a two digit decimal integer that, when appended onto head_word , uniquely identifies the sense of head_word within a lexicographer file, as described for lex_id . There is a value in this field only if head_word is present.


Since the lex_id is lost or may be absent we use

- 00 if there is only one sense for the lexical entry or

- the 1-based index of the Sense within the LexicalEntry if there are more.
